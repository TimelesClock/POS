**Background information** 

In Secondary 3, My school’s WA2 for the Computing subject was to make a python project that can help the community. 
 

I chose to make a point of sale system for startup companies who does not want to pay the expensive monthly fees that some Point-of-Sale system costs.

Through this project, I learned many different skills outside the Computing syllabus such as using Functions and the SQL syntax to create and utilise databases.

I started learning the SQL syntax primarily because I started the project by using .txt files to store data while creating my own list indexing system to index different data values whihc got too complicated and slow when trying to retrieve out certain data.


**Features**  

- Secure login system with password hashing  

- Inventory editor (Add/Delete items, Add/remove stocks, Enable/Disable items)  

- Accounts manager (To manage accounts inside the POS system)  

- Point of sale (Calculates amount of money to be paid by customer)  

- Transaction History  

**Libraries used**  

- sqlite3 – For database access and editing which Is also built into python  

- hashlib, binascii, os – For hashing passwords to store  

- prettytable – For beautifying database tables  

- datetime , pytz - For obtaining time  

- replit – For screen function when running the code in replit.com 


**Points for improvement after the project**   

- Using more efficient ways of coding (Like not calling functions in functions that leads to a chain of function callings in error statement)  

- Making the code neater
